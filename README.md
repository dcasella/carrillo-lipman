# Multiple sequence alignment with Sum-of-Pairs

> Algorithm explained in section 14.6.1 "A speedup for the exact solution" from Dan Gusfield's "Algorithms on Strings, Trees, and Sequences"  

Implementation of the Carrillo-Lipman algorithm for aligning three sequences.  
The algorithm takes in input three strings and a parameter *upper_bound*, and prints the score of the best possible alignment between the strings.
